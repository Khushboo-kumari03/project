E-commerce is a growing trend, particularly in the electronics retail sector. 

This project focuses on creating a dynamic web application that allows users to browse, search, and  
purchase electronic products online. Using modern web technologies like MongoDB and  
Express.js, the website will support both frontend features for users and backend  
functionalities for administrators. 
The system aims to enhance user engagement, improve  
accessibility, and simplify online transactions.

The proposed system is a full-stack dynamic e-commerce website built with: 
- MongoDB for NoSQL database and flexible product/user data management. 
- Express.js for backend API development and server-side routing. 
- Frontend (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and optionally frameworks like Bootstrap or  
React). 
The system will support: 
- Product catalog with filters and search 
- User registration and login 
- Add to cart and checkout functionality 
- Admin panel for product and order management 
- Secure communication using middleware and validations
